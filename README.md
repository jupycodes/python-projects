#python-projects

This repo is a collection of Python projects I took on while learning the language:

1) Chatbots - built a series of (simple) chatbots to better understand Python and how it can be used in a real-world application.I became curious about chatbots when I was interacting with a customer support bot one day. Each bot is slightly smarter than the rest, with alienbot.py being the most complex. It aims to use regex processing to understand intent during a conversation.

2) Loan Calculator - my first intro project to Python. This uses simple if/then logic to calculate aspects of a loan based on user inputs.

3) Neural Networks - A big dive into machine learning algorithms. While some of the concepts were a bit foreign to me this is a really interesting technology that I would love to explore further given the chance.
